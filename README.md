# Language Model Identifier

With a surge of generative pretrained language models, it is becoming increasingly important to distinguish between human and AI-generated text. This package pokes at this question even further by providing a suite of tools to help identify which (publicly available) language model might have been used to generate some given chunck of text.

More documentation to come.
